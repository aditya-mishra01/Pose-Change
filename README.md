# Pose-Change
Cycle GAN based deep learning model that changes pose of a person in an image using pcd data.
The pcd data that i have used contains 14 achor points containing 3 coordinates each representing x,y,z . 
The Model is being trained currently as it requires a considerable amount of computation power , i'm using google colab and it's taking some time because the amount of unit available in the free version is limited.
The Data being used are a set of Images and Pcd data that are paired.   



The Results after 50 epochs :

I hope to soon finish the training and get a model with a more accurate results
